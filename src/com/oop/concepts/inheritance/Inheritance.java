	 	"Is-A" Relationship
		Acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. 
		It is an important part of OOPs.
	
		Inheritance in Java:
			Inheritance is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept where one class acquires the properties (fields) and methods of another class. 
			It is a key feature of Java that supports "reusability" and establishes a parent-child relationship between classes.
	
			Theory of Inheritance:-
				1. Parent Class (Super Class):
					The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class.
					Example: Person class in the earlier example.
	
				2. Child Class (Sub Class):
					The class that inherits the properties and methods of the parent class.
					Example: Student class in the earlier example.
	
				3. extends Keyword:
					Used to establish inheritance in Java.
					Example: class Student extends Person.
	
				4. Benefits of Inheritance:
					# Code Reusability: Write once, use it multiple times.
					# Method Overriding: Allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.
					# Polymorphism: Achieved through method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.
	
			@ Types of Inheritance in Java
				1. Single Inheritance
					A child class inherits from one parent class.
				Example:
					class Parent { }
					class Child extends Parent { }
	
	
				2. Multilevel Inheritance
					A class inherits from a child class, making a chain of inheritance.
					Example
						class GrandParent { }
						class Parent extends GrandParent { }
						class Child extends Parent { }
	
				3. Hierarchical Inheritance
					Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.
					Example:
						class Parent { }
						class Child1 extends Parent { }
						class Child2 extends Parent { }
